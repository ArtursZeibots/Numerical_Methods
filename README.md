# Numerical_Methods

This repository is for creating C programs of Numerical Methods
Numerical Methods are methods for approximating or solving equations with the help of computation.

All code was written in C (C99) and compiled using gnu gcc.
The Repository contains three folders:
1) Equations - Contains Methods that are used to find solutions to equations.
2) Linear_Algebra - Contains Methods commonly used in Linear Algebra
3) Calculus - Has methods for computing Derivatives and Integrals Numerically
